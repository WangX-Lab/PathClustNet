# PathwayGC
PathwayGC identifies cancer subtypes by analyzing gene expression data. It selects variable genes, computes Pearson correlations to form gene clusters, and performs pathway enrichment analysis. A pathway enrichment matrix is then used for hierarchical clustering to determine subtypes. Code and documentation are provided.
